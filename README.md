Repository for my Morrowind mods, some are only for testing


## Morrowind Mouse Control

This mod allows you to replace all keyboard commands for Weapon Ready/spell Ready
with mouse buttons and to select weapons/spells/light with mouse wheel.

You can switch between Weapon Ready / Not Ready / Spell Ready modes with the mouse
middle button. In Weapon Ready mode you will cycle weapons with the mouse wheel and
in Spell Ready mode you will cycle spells/powers.

This is a MWSE-Lua mod, and requires a valid installation of MWSE 2.1 or later.

This mod is available on Nexus Mods https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48254
