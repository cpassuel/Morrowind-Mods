# Morrowind-Mods

Repository for my Morrowind mods, some are for testing only


## Morrowind Mouse Control

This mod allows you to replace all keyboard commands for Weapon Ready/spell Ready
with mouse buttons and to select weapons/spells/light with mouse wheel.

You can switch between Weapon Ready / Not Ready / Spell Ready modes with the mouse
middle button. In Weapon Ready mode you will cycle weapons with the mouse wheel and
in Spell Ready mode you will cycle spells/powers.

This is a MWSE-Lua mod, and requires a valid installation of MWSE 2.1 or later.

This mod is available on Nexus Mods https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48254

## Morrowind Mouse Control for OpenMW (on hold)

Test to port Morrowind Mouse Control to OpenMW. This mod is on hold as there are too
many differences between MWSE and OpenMW Lua implementation that would require a
complete rewrite of the mod. There are also some lacks in OpenMW implementation
(or I didn't search enough or documentation is not enough detailed)

## Sample Mod

The goal of this mod is to give a starting template with some examples to create a
MWSE Lua mod for Morrowind. It show how to create a Mod Config Menu (MCM) and to
use translations. It tries to use the best practices.

This is a MWSE-Lua mod, and requires a valid installation of MWSE 2.1 or later.

This mod is available on Nexus Mods https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52786

## Lockpick Probe Hotkey

Test for auto-equip lockpit / probe
